# Anime Ratings Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes anime data to explore whether measurable factors such as episode count, genre, studio, and release season have an impact on overall anime ratings. The goal is to determine if structural characteristics influence perceived quality.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to evaluate common assumptions within the anime community—such as whether longer series, specific genres, studios, or release seasons result in higher-rated shows—by using data-driven analysis rather than subjective opinion.
